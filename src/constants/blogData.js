These issues are best caught early through regular dental visits.</p><p>Preventive care in your 30s can save you from more extensive and expensive treatments later in life.

In subsequent visits, the canal is filled and sealed permanently, often followed by a crown placement.</p><p>Single-visit root canal treatment, made possible by advances in technology like rotary instruments and digital imaging, completes the entire procedure in one appointment.

Once healed, these posts provide a stable foundation for artificial teeth. Implants look, feel, and function like natural teeth and can last a lifetime with proper care.</p><p>Dentures are removable appliances that replace missing teeth and surrounding tissues.
